# The RBY Expansion Pack
A mod for Pokemon Showdown, specifically the Dragon Heaven server. This mod adds scrapped Pokemon, regional formes, and cross-gen evolutions to Generation 1, with the intention of making the metagame more diverse without actually changing the metagame much. It is intended to be compatible with any competitive Generation 1 format.

Type Chart
====
Dark, Steel, and Fairy are added. Fairy is identical to modern and is of the Special category.

However, there are some differences in Dark and Steel specifically. This is because these incarnations were made before the Nintendo Cup 1997 National Tournament at the SpaceWorld event of that year, which led to the types being excessively buffed. The pre-tournament types are closer to RBY and assist with metagame balance. Generally, everything happens to line up and it makes for a much more competitive tier.
